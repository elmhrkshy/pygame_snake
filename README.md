Followed the video and added the following features on top of it:
1. Increment speed of the game when the snake grabs a food block.
2. Teleporting the snake when it hits the edges.
3. Preventing the snake to in the opposite direction, i.e. when moving in up direction, pressing down arrow key won't work.
